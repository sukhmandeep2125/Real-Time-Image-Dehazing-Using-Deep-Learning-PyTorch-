# Real-Time-Image-Dehazing-Using-Deep-Learning-PyTorch-
Developed a real-time image dehazing pipeline using a custom U-Net-based deep learning model in PyTorch. Enabled fast inference via pretrained weights without requiring ground truth during deployment. Built with OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Google Colab.
